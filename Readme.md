and it really helped me to practice along with the exercises like some git commands

This was all to me examples are like
                                        
<!-- Command                                        Description -->

-> ssh-keygen -C "your email"			---- Creates your SSH KEY
-> touch [touch file name] 			---- which creates new file
-> git status
-> git add [file-name] 				---- which adds it to the staging step before committing    the                                        changes
-> git init	       				---- initializing command ?
-> ls	  	      				 ---- showing the repositories we have cloned 
-> cd [folder_name]    				---- entering a folder
